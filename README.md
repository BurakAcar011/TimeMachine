# What even is this? 
This is a "time machine" program that brings you back in time by making a Spotify list of hit songs of a specified date.
All you do is specify a date, and the program uses scrapes the web to find the top 100 songs of that date.
The program then uses Spotipy to add those songs to your Spotify playlist, making a playlist that takes you back in time.

# Before starting...
Make sure to either log in or sign up to Spotipy.
Then, find your Client ID and Client Secret and put them into the .env file in the program.
This way, it can be added to YOUR playlist.
